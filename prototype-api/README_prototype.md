Context Service prototype supporting the aequitas-lib.
Current version is compatible with D3.1/D4.1.

## Usage:
* (create venv)
* pip install -r requirements
* python aeq-api/server.py

This starts a flask development server running the prototype context service.

**Important note:** 
This supporting software is not officially part of D3.1/D4.1 itself.
This prototype may be subject to change, the branch demo_3_1 
will remain compatible with D3.1/D4.1 for the near future.
